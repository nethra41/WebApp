Final Project CS575:-
	Clear, self-explanatory, easy-to-use and to visualize the process. Provide an opportunity to make the page replacement process easier to understand.
Purpose:-
	A teaching tool. Visualizing algorithms can make them easier to understand. Both instructors and students can benefit from a simulator - easier to teach, easier to learn.
Concept:-
	Page Replacement concept. 
		With demand paging, physical memory fills quickly. So, when there is a process fault and memory full, some page must be replaced. Highly motivated from the homework problems of the class. 
	Which page should be replaced ?
		Optimal page replacement. Replace the page that won’t be needed for long time. Nice & optimal, but unrealizable.
		Least Recently Used(LRU) page replacement. Replace the page that hasn’t been referenced for long time. Nice & good, but expensive.
Execution:-
	UnZip the folder.
	Open the index.html on any firefox or chorme.
	In landing page, on the right side you should be able to see accordion with various input values.
	Under the first accordion, that is open by default,
		Click "Access TLB", then
		Click "Access Page Table", then
		Click "Update", then
		Click "Physical Address", then
	Repeat this process of the rest of the input in the accordion.
	In the same, you should be able to see an orange button "Page Replacement"
	On clicking it, goes to the next page.
	Click the reference string, Starting the first value to the end on both Optimal & LRU
